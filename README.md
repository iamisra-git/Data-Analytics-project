The data that was operated  for this project is for Spam and Non Spam Email detection.For these two datasets training and testing were loaded,for model training and testing process
respectively.These datasets had more number of nonspam emails than spam email.The other interesting fact about these datasets is that the division of train and test data has been done in a 70% for training which had about 3621 observations and-30% test dataset which had about 1551 observations ratio which is a perfect ratio for model training and predicting, so the data 
did not have to be split.This data is categorical data as it requires categorising of emails into two different classes spam and non-spam.Each email has been assigned a category which makes it a classification problem.Furthermore, spam and non-spam email detection is also categorised as  a supervised learning problem as it involves training models on the basis of labelled data  to classify the emails into predefined categories.
